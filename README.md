# Version Control with Git & GitHub — Exercises repo

This repository contains the hands-on exercises for the "Version Control with Git and GitHub" course (assignment 1). It's a small working repo used to practice basic Git commands and GitHub workflows.

Contents
- `index.html` — sample HTML page used in the exercises
- `foo`, `bar`, `baz` — small example files created during the exercises
- Exercises.txt` — exercise notes and outputs

Exercises covered
- 1.3.1 — creating files, staging, committing
- 1.4.1 — staging all changes, amending commits
- 1.5.1 — using `git log` and `git log -p`
- 1.6.1 — basic HTML edits and validation
- 2.1 / 2.2 / 2.3.1 — working with GitHub and updating README

Quick notes
- There is no build step — these are file-based Git exercises.
- Use `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git log` to explore the history and exercise results.
